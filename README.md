# Multiplayer UNO Game using MERN Stack

## Overview
This project is a multiplayer UNO game built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. UNO is a classic card game where players aim to be the first to empty their hand of cards by matching the card in the discard pile by color, number, or symbol.

## Features
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Players can join rooms and play against each other in real-time.
- **Game Mechanics**: Implement UNO game rules such as drawing cards, playing cards, skipping turns, reversing direction, etc.
- **Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and save their progress.
- **Leaderboard**: Track players' scores and display a leaderboard.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data, game state, and leaderboard scores.
- **Express.js**: To build the backend server and RESTful API endpoints.
- **React**: For building the frontend user interface and interactive game components.
- **Node.js**: To run the server-side code and manage dependencies.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between players in the game rooms.

Additionally, we use `jest` for backend tests.
