// this module is responsible for handling the clients currently connected to the server.
// It stores the clients in a Map object, where the key is the client id and the value is the
// client's http response object.
// When sending an event, we first push the event to a queue. We need to use a queue because it
// is possible that the client hasn't sent the next polling request yet, i.e, we don't have a response
// object for that client yet. When the client sends the next polling request, we will send the events
// from the queue to the client.
